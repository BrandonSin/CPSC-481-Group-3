# Iteration P1
<p>In this iteration, we focussed on Investigating and developing ideas in approaching our VR project. We made necessary research and interviews in order to gain a better understanding of our goals and aim. </P>

### P1
<p> In the below PDF is our P1 iteration document. In this document, we will introduce our project, roles of our stakeholders, interview responses and our findings in the research. </P>[P1 Documents](P1/P1.pdf)

### Interview Questions
<p> The link below is a PDF file regarding the interview questions we asked towards our interviewees. </p>[Interview Questions](P1/Interview Questions.pdf)

### Secondary Research
<p> We made much needed research in the field of virtual reality. We found out about equipments needed for immersion enhancement and how VR can impact our learning and senses. Our research can be found in the link below.</p>[Secondary Research](P1/Secondary Research.pdf)



# Iteration P2
<p>In this iteration, we focussed on creating a low fidelity prototpe of our application using Balsamiq. </P>

### P2-Presentation
<p> In the below PDF is our P2 presentation. In this document we talk about our idea, reasearch methods, what the user is able to do with our application and finally corrections on our protoype as suggested by the TA and thier solutions. </P>[P2-Presentation](P2/P2 Presentation.pdf)

# Iteration P3
### Description of Iteration P3
<p>In this iteration, we focussed on creating a high fidelity prototype using Adobe XD. We used the feedbacks from our T.A and Professor and the outline from our Balsamiq prototype to help flushout the designs of the hi-fi prototype. Particularly this iteration, we mainly focussed on the task of purchasing a VR video from our collection. The process of this showcase would be going into "My Events" which should be empty as there are no purchases. Afterwards, we would buy a VR video from the store and select preview/play. Finally, we would go back to "MY Events" and the video should be there. Other tasks are included in this iteration but may not be completely functional or optimized.</p>

### High Fidelity Prototype - Adobe XD
<p>The download link below is the High Fidelity Prototype made in Adobe XD. Some functions still require optimizations and implemenations. Specifically, the calendar still needs a bit more work before fully functioning. </p>
